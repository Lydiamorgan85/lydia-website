    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently diving deep into cloud technologies, learning how to design scalable, secure, and efficient architectures using platforms like Google Cloud and AWS. My passion lies in building systems that solve real-world problems and empower businesses to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to become a certified Cloud Architect and work on projects that make a meaningful impact‚Äîwhether it's optimizing infrastructure for startups or contributing to global sustainability through smart tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is my digital sandbox, where I‚Äôll share my progress, projects, and maybe even a few lessons learned along the way.
